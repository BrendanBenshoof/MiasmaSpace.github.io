"Miasma" was inspired by Neal Stephenson's ["Fall; or, Doge in Hell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall;_or,_Dodge_in_Hell). I think Neal was addressing his inability to predict the reality of the internet back in the 1990s and called it, quite accurately, "The Miasma". When considering making this blog I was thinking about that concept, and the space of available domains that cost less than $1000 led me here.

I intend Miasma Space to be a collection of my opinions on a wide range of topics, some of which I am even an expert in.
Including but not limited to:

- P2P distributed systems and infrastructure
- Programming and System design
- Radical architecture
- Getting humans moved into O'Neal Cylinders
- Society-engineering (because Social-engineering is for users)
