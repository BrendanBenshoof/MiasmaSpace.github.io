Minecraft Mods
==============

As part of coping with the Coronavirus quarantine I have found myself playing minecraft a lot more. I’m starting a server (details should be added in the vague future) and I had a few small tweaks I wanted and I found minecraft plugins to be a lot simpler than I expected. 

My goals with this collection of mods are:
- Be simple and easy to maintain
- Do 1 thing well per-mod
- Feel like “native minecraft”, no commands or wierd UIs

My current mod collection:
- [Sylscart](https://github.com/MiasmaSpace/SylsCarts)
-- Made at request of a friend to make minecart systems more viable. Carts don't decelerate on rails and the break when you hop out of them
- [MotdSnark](https://github.com/MiasmaSpace/MotdSnark)
-- Simple mod to provide a random MOTD
- [EggDrop](https://github.com/MiasmaSpace/EggDrop)
-- I wanted a “native” feeling way for players to access mob eggs in survival, gives mobs a 10% chance of dropping eggs when killed with a “Silk Touch” enchanted weapon.
